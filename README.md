# Investigate a Dataset (TMDb movie data)
 By Abhijit Dey

In this project, I analyzez a dataset and communicated my findings about it. I used the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to do the analysis

This Python script is written for Project 3 (Term 1) of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) and is used to explore TMDb movie data. But what determines if a movie is considered as good or bad? There could be several factors influencig the quality of a movie, as for example the budget, genre, etc. This little project helped the author to improve his data analytics skills and explore some of the success criteria for movies.

First some Data Wrangling was applied, before the data was cleaned in order to perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
